# unity-autonomy
This project was completed during Fall semester of my sophomore year in my Interactive Media Development class. I worked on this project solo and it was focused on creating a Unity project that had objects functioning in a realistic way. The goal was to think of a scene that could be represented in Unity and scripted to use advanced steering behaviors to have the objects react to each other in appropriate ways for the scene.I chose to do a scene that involved a sheep dog herding a flock of sheep from the pasture back to their pen. I chose to use behaviors of leader following, path following, object avoidance etc
